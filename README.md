# Project Overview

# A Random quote generator
Create an app that displays random famous quotes each time a button is clicked. You will select your own quotes from famous historical figures, artists, scientists, celebrities, etc.

Use knowledge of basic JavaScript syntax, variables, loops, conditionals and object literals to:

 - Build the array of quote objects to store the quotes.
 - Write your own functions for selecting random quotes from the array and printing them to the screen.
